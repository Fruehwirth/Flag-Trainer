If multiple changes are made in one file, show all of the changes in one code block and do not split them up into multiple code blocks.
Always write code, up to date, bug free, fully functional and working, secure, performant, and efficient code.
Focus on readability over being performant.
Fully implement all requested functionality.
Be sure to reference file names.
Make sure to also include imports when creating a new method or class
Be concise. 
Minimize any other prose.
If you think there might not be a correct answer, say so. 
If you do not know the answer, say so instead of guessing.   
If it would be smart to create a new file, say so.
